        <p>Ada Lovelace's edition of the translated article included multiple early computer 
programs(algorithms) and also raised possibilities on possible uses of the machine, such as 
in the creation and editing of music and symbols. In one of her notes, she explains an 
algorithm that allows for the Analytical Engine to calculate Bernouli numbers. This algorithm 
is the first of it's kind to be specially designed for integration on a computer.<br><br><br>

Ada Lovelace's sketches and designs for the program of the analytical engine were one of 
the most intricate and whole compared to Babbage's other assistants. Due to these reasons, 
Ada Lovelace is generally referred to as 'the first computer programmer'.<br><br><br>

Aside from introducing the first computer program and inspiring new insights on the capabilities
 of computers, Ada Lovelace's notes were also one of the most significant documents in providing
 inspiration to Alan Turing's work on the earliest modern computers during the 1940s.<br><br><br>

Ada Lovelace's notes and contribution to the computing society were one of the driving forces
 to inspiring and realizing the first modern computers and by extension the computers we see 
today. Her incredible insight and powerful ideas were a boon to the technological community, 
until even being referred to as 'The Enchantress of Numbers' by Babbage himself.</p><br><br>
