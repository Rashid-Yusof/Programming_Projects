    <h1>The First Computer Program</h1><br>

        <p>In 1883, Mary Sommerville, Ada's mentor, introduced her to Charles Babbage. 
Ada and Charles both shared unorthodox personalities and ended up developing a strong, 
lifelong friendship.<br><br><br>

Charles was working on a design for a complicated device called the Analytical engine, 
the successor to his previous invention, the difference engine. The analytical engine was an 
idea for a mechanical general-purpose computer. Ada was incredibly intrigued by his work.<br><br><br>

In the year 1840, Charles was invited to deliver a seminar at the University of Turin 
regarding his Analytical engine. This talk, was transcripted in French by a person named 
Luigi Menabrea and was published in the Bibliotheque universelle de Geneve in October 1842.<br><br><br>

Later on, Charles Wheatstone -a friend of Charles Babbage- commissioned Ada Lovelace to 
translate Luigi Menabrea's paper into English. With the help and input of Babbage, Ada 
completed the translation and also added her own notes in, ending up with a more expanded 
version than Menabrea's paper. This was then published in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs and 
republished again later in 1953.</p><br><br>
