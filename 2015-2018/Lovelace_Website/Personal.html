    <h1>The life of Ada Lovelace</h1><br>

        <p>Augusta Ada Lovelace, Countess of Lovelace; or more commonly known as 
Ada Lovelace; was born in the year 1815 on the 10th of December. She was a 
British mathematician and writer whose work was one of the first stepping stones 
to the development of the first modern computer. </p><br>

    <h2>Early Years</h2>

        <p>Ada Lovelace is the child of Anne Isabella Milbanke, Baroness Wentworth 
who was married to the poet George Gordon, Lord Byron, who divorced Anna a month 
later after Ada's birth. He died later on when Ada was 8 years old due to disease 
in the Greek war of independence. Anna, still having ill feelings toward Gordon, 
influenced and encouraged Ada to have an interest in mathematics and logic, to stop 
her from following in the footsteps of her father.</p><br>

    <h2>Childhood</h2>

        <p>Ada was often left in the care of Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, the mother 
of Anna. Anna was not very close to Ada, and only showed affection in an attempt to 
maintain a 'loving mother' image due to societal attitudes which mainly preferred the 
father in a divorce. <br> <br><br>

Ada often fell sick in her early childhood, having developed 
headaches that affected her sight and becoming paralysed after being infected with measles. 
Despite these circumstances however, Ada developed good grasps on mathematical and 
technical skills.</p> <br><br>

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>At the age of 12, Ada tried to develop a method of flying.</li>
            <li>Ada loved gambiling, and tried to develop a mathematical model 
of successful large bets in 1851.</li>
        </ul><br><br>
